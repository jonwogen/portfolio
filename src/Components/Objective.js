			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>Being a visual artist yet also a meticulous coder, I have found passion in the structure and beauty of electronic design. Always an avid pupil, yet learning daily as a compassionate leader, I make it a goal to establish strong connections with fellow team members. My objective is to master modern technologies and frameworks, and in turn offer my growing web development knowledge and experience in collaboration to help an exceptional company thrive.</p>
			<p className="note">NOTE: I haven't had a portfolio up in years. I'm having fun with this site, dabbling in silly things again. More content to come...</p>
